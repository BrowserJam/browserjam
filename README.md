# Browser Jam

Hello friends! Welcome to Browser Jam, like a weekend game jam but instead of games, we build web browsers!

## Upcoming Browser Jam

The inaugural Browser Jam will take place on Sep 13th thru 15th, 2024.

- It begins on [Sep 13th at 4pm UTC](https://everytimezone.com/?t=66e4d200,-1e0).
- It ends on [Sep 15th at 4pm UTC](https://everytimezone.com/?t=66e4d200,960).

Join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/MAmkZ5BPEK) to participate!

Browsers should be submitted as PRs to the [jam001](https://github.com/BrowserJam/jam001) repo before the jam ends.

## How it works

- At the start of the jam, a piece of HTML is revealed.
- Everyone now has until the end of the jam to build a from-scratch browser that can render the HTML.
- At the end of the jam, we will reveal an additional HTML file that makes use of the same features as the first file. Hopefully your browser can render this one as well!

## Who can jam?

Everyone is welcome to jam! You can participate solo, or as a team. If you'd like to find people to team up with, join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/MAmkZ5BPEK)!

## What tech can I use?

Any programming language. Any libraries. Go nuts!

However, don't use existing browser engine code. The point of the jam is to get everyone implementing little browsers from scratch!

## How do I submit my browser?

Once finished, you submit your browser as a PR to the current jam repository. Please add it as a top-level directory. Make sure you include a README that names everyone who worked on the browser (and contains instructions for building and testing!)

## Who wins the jam?

If you have fun while participating, you've won!

We will also pick a small number of cool browsers and showcase them.
