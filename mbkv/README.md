# mbkv browser

What's a browser without some dead memes?

![Yo dawg, I heard you like browsers so I put a browser in your browser so you can browse while you browse](meme.jpeg)

## Build instructions:

* install bun
* `bun install && bun start`
* visit everyone's favorite new browser ladybird and connect to http://localhost:3000
* alternatively visit https://browser.mbkv.io with ladybird using the linux option `--enable-qt-networking`, unclear why ladybird's request code fails to load

Of course this works with other browsers as well

I did a lot of it within the jam. I did use a ~550 line HTML parser I made a
couple of weeks ago. I didn't know what was going to be included in the
browserjam so I wanted to make sure I'd have time to finish while writing most
of my code from scratch. I kind of regret it now since I'm fairly certain I
could have hacked together a non-compliant html parser for this very easily
